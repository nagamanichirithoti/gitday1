<h1>What is Git?</h1>
<p>Git is a version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to work together and track revisions.</p>

<h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
<p>GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing additional features for collaboration like pull requests, issue tracking, and more. It allows developers to work on projects, share code, and manage versions.</p>

<h2>Basic Git Workflow</h2>
<p>Setting up a repository: Create a local repository to manage files and track changes.</p>
<p>Making changes: Modify code or add new files.</p>
<p>Staging changes: Mark changes to be committed.</p>
<p>Committing changes: Save a snapshot of the current changes.</p>
<p>Pushing to a remote repository: Upload changes to GitHub or another Git server.</p>
<p>Collaborating: Fetch and merge changes from others.</p>
<p>Branching: Work on new features or fixes in isolated environments.</p>
<p>Merging: Combine branches into the main branch.</p>
<h2>Essential Git Commands</h2>
<pre>1. Initial Setup Commands
git init
Initializes a new Git repository. Run this in the root directory of your project.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git init
git clone [URL]
Copies an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
git remote add origin [URL]
Connects your local repository to a remote one (like on GitHub).</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
2. Making Changes
git status
Shows the status of changes in your working directory. It's useful to check which files have been modified or staged.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git status
git add [file_name] or git add .
Stages a file or all files (.) to be committed.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git add file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "[message]"
Commits staged changes with a descriptive message.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add feature X"
3. Working with Remote Repositories
git push origin [branch_name]
Pushes your changes to the remote repository. For example, to push to the main branch:</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git push origin main
git pull origin [branch_name]
Fetches changes from the remote branch and merges them into the current branch.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
git fetch
Downloads updates from the remote repository without merging.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git fetch
4. Branching and Merging
git branch [branch_name]
Creates a new branch. A branch is an isolated environment to work on specific changes.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git branch feature-branch
git checkout [branch_name]
Switches to the specified branch.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git checkout feature-branch
git merge [branch_name]
Merges the specified branch into the current branch.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git merge feature-branch
git branch -d [branch_name]
Deletes a branch.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git branch -d feature-branch
5. Undoing Changes
git reset [file_name]
Unstages a file, moving it from the staging area back to modified.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git reset file.txt
git revert [commit_id]
Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a specific commit.</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git revert a1b2c3d
Example Git Workflow
Initialize a Repository</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git init
Connect to GitHub Repository</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
Create a Branch</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
Add Changes & Commit</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented feature"
Push Branch to GitHub</pre>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git push origin feature-branch
Open a Pull Request on GitHub
Merge your feature branch into the main branch.</pre>

<h2>Update Local Main Branch</h2>

<pre>bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
By following this guide, you'll be able to manage code versions effectively and collaborate on GitHub projects with ease.</pre>
